Narrowing Down Schools: A general rule of thumb used is that students apply to 3-4 schools. It all varies student-to-student applications cost money, however you may be applicable for a fee waiver. Students can be overwhelmed or completely unaware of possible schools. There are school search engines such as Petersonâ€™s college search, which can find schools based on location, finances, interest of study and more. It is important to map out what matters most to you and then find a school that best fits your individual college experience. Some things to consider are financial capabilities, location and student body environment. By student body environment you should be thinking about whether you want to go to a school with a big sports team or maybe you enjoy concerts or special talks on the latest in science. All of these things you think of when you imagine your dream school are things you may want to consider.
